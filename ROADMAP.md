## 🎯 **Development Strategy**

### **Token Optimization Approach**
1. **Work in small increments** - Fix one feature at a time
2. **Focus on core functionality first** - Get basic features working
3. **Add complexity gradually** - Build upon working foundation
4. **Test frequently** - Ensure each phase works before moving on

### **Priority Order**
1. **Fix current issues** (tournament creation, authentication)
2. **Complete basic features** (CRUD operations)
3. **Add database integration** (Supabase connection)
4. **Implement payments** (eSewa integration)
5. **Polish and optimize** (performance, UX)

### **File Organization Strategy**
- Keep core files minimal and focused
- Add features in separate, well-organized modules
- Use clear naming conventions
- Document each phase's changes
