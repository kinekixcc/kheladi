**🚀 Quick Fix for Market Launch:**
```typescript
// Use your personal bank account temporarily
const BANK_DETAILS = {
  bankName: "Your Bank Name",
  accountNumber: "1234567890",
  accountHolder: "Your Name",

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX**

### **1. Empty Database**
**Problem:** No tournaments showing in Facilities page
**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Add sample tournaments for testing
INSERT INTO tournaments (name, sport_type, status, visibility, ...) VALUES
('Football Championship', 'Football', 'approved', 'public', ...),
('Basketball League', 'Basketball', 'approved', 'public', ...);
```

### **2. Tournament Registration**
**Problem:** No clear tournament joining mechanism
**Solution:** Implement the missing `joinTournament` method in database service

### **3. Venue-Tournament Connection**
**Problem:** Facilities page shows tournaments instead of actual facilities
**Solution:** Update to show sports venues/facilities instead of tournaments
